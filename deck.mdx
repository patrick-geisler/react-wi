## React.memo()

`React.memo()` is a HOC(Higher Order Component) that can be wrapped around any functional(stateless) component to create 'memorized' components. What this means in practice is, the wrapped component will only rerender when it's props change. This is much like the class(stateful) lifecycle method `shouldComponentUpdate()`

This allows a component that renders the same given the same props to be stored in memory. This allows the component to skip being rerendered and will give very nice performance boosts. It will simply reuse the last rendered result of the component.

This props compare that memo performs is a shallow one, and `memo()` can be passed a second param that can do deeper evaluations.

```javascript 
// import React and descructure memo as well
import React, { memo } from 'react'

// Stateless Funcitonal Component
const Comp = props => {
    /* render using props */
}

// Deeper Props Evaluation Function
const areEqual = (prevProps, nextProps) => {
    /* return a boolean result if they pass or not */
}

// wrap our Stateless Component in memo
export default memo(Comp, areEqual)

```

## React.lazy()

`React.lazy()` is simply a way to render a dynamically imported component as a regular component. This means the component being imported will only be truly imported when the component is actually rendered. If it is not rendered then the component will never be added tot he js file and there for keeps the file smaller.

Although `Suspense` was not added in 16.6 it is good to mention that `lazy()` works very well in tandom with a `<Suspense>` component. Allowing for a fallback state if the lazy imported component takes some time to import.

```javascript
// import React and descructure lazy as well
import React, { lazy } from 'react'

// =============== BEFORE ============== //
// normal import of component
import Component from './Component'
// normal use of component in parent.
const NewComp = () => {
    return (
        <React.Fragment>
            <Component />
        </React.Fragment>
    )
}

// =============== AFTER ============== //
// lazy import
const Component = lazy(() => import('./Component'))
// normal use of component in parent.
const NewComp = () => {
    return (
        <React.Fragment>
            <Component />
        </React.Fragment>
    )
}


```
