## React.memo()

`React.memo()` is a HOC  that can be wrapped around any functional component to create 'memoized' components. 

```notes
The wrapped component will only rerender when it's props change. 

Similar to  class(stateful) lifecycle method `shouldComponentUpdate()`

A component that renders the same given the same props to be stored in memory. 

This allows the component to skip being rerendered will simply reuse the last rendered result of the component.

```

## React.memo() Example
```javascript

class App extends Component {
  // Set State
  // Handle Click count++
  render() {
    return (
      <div className="App">
        <div>
          {this.state.count}
        </div>
        <button onClick={this.handleClick}>
        This is a button
        </ button>
        <AnotherComponent text={'Title'}/>
      </div>
    );
  }
}

```

---

## React.memo() Example
```javascript

import React, { memo } from 'react'

const AnotherComponent = ({ text }) => {
  console.log('AnotherComponent is rendering')
  return(
    <div>
      { text }
    </ div>
  )
}

export default memo(AnotherComponent)

```

## Custom Comparisons

```javascript 
import React, { memo } from 'react'

// Stateless Funcitonal Component
const AnotherComponent = props => {}

const areEqual = (prevProps, nextProps) => {}
  /*
  return true if passing nextProps to render would return
  the same result as passing prevProps to render,
  otherwise return false
  */

export default memo(AnotherComponent, areEqual)

```

## Custom Comparisons

This method only exists as a `performance optimization`. Do not rely on it to “prevent” a render.

## React.lazy()

`React.lazy()` is simply a way to render a dynamically imported component as a regular component. This means the component being imported will only be truly imported when the component is actually rendered. If it is not rendered then the component will never be added tot he js file and there for keeps the file smaller.

Although `Suspense` was not added in 16.6 it is good to mention that `lazy()` works very well in tandom with a `<Suspense>` component. Allowing for a fallback state if the lazy imported component takes some time to import.

```javascript
// import React and descructure lazy as well
import React, { lazy } from 'react'

// =============== BEFORE ============== //
// normal import of component
import Component from './Component'
// normal use of component in parent.
const NewComp = () => {
    return (
        <React.Fragment>
            <Component />
        </React.Fragment>
    )
}

// =============== AFTER ============== //
// lazy import
const Component = lazy(() => import('./Component'))
// normal use of component in parent.
const NewComp = () => {
    return (
        <React.Fragment>
            <Component />
        </React.Fragment>
    )
}


```
