# Whats New in 16.6-16.8??

A talk by [@patrick-geisler]() and [@caryyon]() given at the [MKE-Reactjs-Meetup](https://www.meetup.com/ReactJS-Wisconsin/).

---

## Main Topics

* React.memo()
* React.lazy()
* static contextType()
* static getDerivedStateFromError()
* Hooks

---

## React.memo()

`React.memo()` is a HOC  that can be wrapped around any functional component to create 'memoized' components. 

```notes
The wrapped component will only rerender when it's props change. 

Similar to  class(stateful) lifecycle method `shouldComponentUpdate()`

A component that renders the same given the same props to be stored in memory. 

This allows the component to skip being rerendered will simply reuse the last rendered result of the component.

```
---

## React.memo() Example
```javascript

class App extends Component {
  state = {count: 0}
  render() {
    return (
      <React.Fragment>
        {this.state.count}
        <button onClick={()=>this.setState(count++)} />
        <AnotherComponent />
      </React.Fragment>
    );
  }
}

```

---

## React.memo() Example
```javascript

import React, { memo } from 'react'

const AnotherComponent = ({ text }) => {
  console.log('AnotherComponent is rendering')
  return(
    <div>
      { text }
    </ div>
  )
}

export default memo(AnotherComponent)

```
---

# React.memo() Example

---

## Custom Comparisons

```javascript 
import React, { memo } from 'react'

// Stateless Funcitonal Component
const AnotherComponent = props => {}

const areEqual = (prevProps, nextProps) => {}
  /*
  return false to rerender
  */

export default memo(AnotherComponent, areEqual)

```


---

## Custom Comparisons

This method only exists as a `performance optimization`. Do not rely on it to prevent a render.



---

## React.lazy()

`React.lazy()` is a way to render a dynamically imported component.

---

## React.Suspense

Lets you specify a fallback UI in case some components in the tree below it are not yet ready to render.


---
## React.Suspense

Rendering lazy components requires that there’s a `<React.Suspense>` component higher in the rendering tree.
---

## React.lazy() Example

```javascript
import React, { lazy, Suspense } from 'react'
```

```notes
Destructure lazy and Suspense from react
```
---
## React.lazy()

```javascript
const Component = lazy(() => import('./Component'))

const NewComp = () => {
    return (
        <React.Suspense fallback={<Loader />}>
            <Component />
        </React.Suspense>
    )
}


```
---
## React.lazy() Example

---

## static contextType()

Convenience API to consume a context value from within a class component.

---
## static contextType()

```javascript
import { MyContext } from './MyContext'

class UseContext extends Component {
  static contextType = MyContext
  componentDidMount(){
    let value = this.context
    // Do something at mount using MyContext
  }
  render(){
    let value = this.context
    // Render something based on MyContext
  }
}

```

---

## Static getDerivedStateFromError()

Lifecycle method to render a fallback UI before the render completes

```notes

componentDidCatch() - fired after the error
logging, showing different UI by calling setState()


Before that is fired, null is rendered in place of the tree that threw the error

Can break parent components that don’t expect their refs to be empty

```

## React 16.7

Performance bugfix for React.lazy
---
## React 16.8

Why Hooks?

---

## Why Hooks?

- Very large components
- Complicated component tree
- Classes can be confusing
- No smaller way to introduce state than class components

```notes
 - Large components are hard to refactor
 - Splitting up components can create tons of wrapping and complexity in the component tree
 - Binding, this, and constructors can be confusing
```

---


## Why Hooks

 Hooks allow functional components to have local state

---

## UseState Hook

 ```js
 const [state, setState] = useState({});
 ```

---

## UseState Hook

```js
 const [isOnline, setIsOnline] = useState(true);
 const [clientName, setClientName] = useState(null);
 ```
---

## UseState Hook

```js
 const [isOnline, setIsOnline] = useState(true);
 const [clientName, setClientName] = useState(null);

 setClientName('John Doe')
 ```
---

## useEffect Hook
- Perform side effects in function components

- useEffect() runs both on initial render and on subsequent updates

```notes
- Think of it as componentDidMount, componentDidUpdate, and componentWillUnmount combined
- Can be altered for performance
- Effect can return a function to clean up and unsubscribe
```

---

### useEffect Hook

``` js
useEffect(() => {
    logClient(
      'clientID', window.__STATE__.meta.clientID
    )
}
``` 

```notes

---

## useEffect Hook

Cleaning up an Effect Hook

---

## useEffect Hook

Old way:

```js
componentDidMount(){
  Client.subscribeToClientStatus(
    clientID, 
    status => setIsOnline(status)
  )
}

componentWillUnmount(){
  Client.unsubscribeFromClientStatus(
    clientID,
    status => setIsOnline(status)
  )
}

```

```notes
- Avoid writing mirrored code in seperate lifecycle methods
```

---

## useEffect Hook

With Hooks:
``` js
useEffect(() => {
    Client.subscribeToClientStatus(
      clientID, 
      status => setIsOnline(status)
    )
    // Specify how to clean up after this effect:
    return function cleanup() {
      Client.unsubscribeFromClientStatus(
        clientID, 
        status => setIsOnline(status)
        );
    };
  });
``` 
```notes
- React performs the cleanup() when the component unmounts. However effects run for every render and not just once. 
- Don’t have to  return named function
- React also cleans up effects from the previous render before running the effects next time.
```
---

## Other Hooks:
- useContext
- useReducer
- useCallback
- useMemo
- useRef
- useImperativeHandle
- useLayoutEffect
- useDebugValue

---

## Custom Hooks

Extract component logic into reusable functions
```

# Custom Hooks

Do I have to name my custom Hooks starting with “use”?

---


# Custom Hooks

Yes
(but not really)


```notes
This convention is very important. 
Without it, we wouldn’t be able to automatically 
check for violations of rules of Hooks because we couldn’t 
tell if a certain function contains calls to Hooks inside of it.

```
---
<!-- 
# Testing Custom Hooks

- Stay away from implementation details
- Don't call custom hooks manually

```notes
"Hooks can only be called inside the body of a function component."
```

--- -->

# Gotcha

- Do not call hooks in a conditional
- Hooks must be used at the top level of a component

---

## Future
- Are classes dead?
